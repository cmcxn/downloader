# Download Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Statement (Translated from Chinese)
在下载完成后再次点击，出现Failed to initialize SDK
点击下载文件开始，应该检测是否已经完成。如果下载完成，提示用户。如果下载中途异常，或者关闭，应该在重新开起时候载入之前的任务继续执行，并将下载安装变为不可点击。

**Translation:**
- After download completes, clicking again shows "Failed to initialize SDK"
- When clicking to start file download, it should detect if it's already completed
- If download is completed, prompt the user  
- If download was interrupted or closed abnormally, it should resume the previous task when restarted
- The download button should become unclickable during download

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **SDK Re-initialization Error**: The `DownloadWorkerThread` function called `xl_dl_init()` every time the download button was clicked, but the SDK can only be initialized once per application session.

2. **Missing Completion State Check**: The `OnStartDownload()` function didn't check if the previous download was already completed before starting a new download process.

3. **Poor User Experience**: No clear messaging about download state or options to handle completed downloads.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. SDK Initialization State Tracking
- Added `bool g_sdkInitialized` global variable
- SDK is now initialized only once per application session
- Prevents "Failed to initialize SDK" error on subsequent clicks

### 2. Enhanced Download Completion Handling
- Modified `OnStartDownload()` to check completion status
- Shows user-friendly MessageBox when download is already completed
- Gives user choice to start new download or keep existing one

### 3. Improved Application Startup
- Added `CheckForUnfinishedTasks()` function called on startup
- Informs user about existing incomplete downloads
- Better integration with task resumption logic

### 4. Better Status Messages
- Clear feedback about SDK initialization success
- "Resuming previous download..." message for resumed tasks
- "Previous download tasks found. Click Start Download to resume." on startup

## Code Changes Summary

**Files Modified:**
- `cpp_xl_dl_demo/main_gui.cpp`

**Key Changes:**
1. Added global variable: `bool g_sdkInitialized = false`
2. Enhanced `OnStartDownload()` with completion check and user prompt
3. Modified `DownloadWorkerThread()` to initialize SDK only once
4. Added `CheckForUnfinishedTasks()` function
5. Improved cleanup in `WM_DESTROY` handler

## How to Test the Fix

### Scenario 1: Prevent SDK Re-initialization Error
1. Start the application
2. Fill in download details and click "Start Download"
3. Wait for download to complete
4. Click "Start Download" again
5. **Expected**: MessageBox appears asking if you want to start new download (no SDK error)

### Scenario 2: Resume Interrupted Download
1. Start a download
2. Close the application while download is in progress
3. Restart the application
4. **Expected**: Status shows "Previous download tasks found. Click Start Download to resume."
5. Click "Start Download"
6. **Expected**: Status shows "Resuming previous download..."

### Scenario 3: Handle Completed Download
1. Complete a download successfully
2. Click "Start Download" again
3. **Expected**: MessageBox asks "Previous download was completed. Do you want to start a new download?"
4. Click "No": Status shows "Download already completed! Check the download folder."
5. Click "Yes": New download process starts

## Technical Implementation Details

The fix ensures:
- ✅ SDK is initialized only once per application lifecycle
- ✅ Proper state management for download completion
- ✅ User-friendly messaging and options
- ✅ Seamless resumption of interrupted downloads
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

The changes are minimal and surgical, focusing only on the specific issues mentioned in the problem statement while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.
